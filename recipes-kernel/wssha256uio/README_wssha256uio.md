# STATUS = not stable


* Currently crashes at entry to sha256() in wssha.c
* UIO is now showing up from device tree as uio0, after changing bootargs to load environment from uEnv.txt. Had to manually setenv from the uBoot command line. 
* Interesting that the UIO crashes immediately, even though I am using the xilinx autogenerated code
